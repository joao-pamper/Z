# Group work break-down strategy
Firstly, we separated functions of what we thought seemed to represent the problem well. Our division was as follows:    
ask_login() ; (LUIS), search_users() ; (LUIS + SRIVANTH), search_tweets(); (JUAN), print_menu(); (LUIS), list_follower(); (JOAO), retweet_reply(); (JOAO), compose_tweets(); (SRIVANTH), see_tweets(); (JUAN)

After that we divided them equally between our group members and went on to work separately on each function. We tested our own functions before combining everything together to avoid major debugging once we assembled all functions to finalize the application.    

# Code execution guide
Run the following command while being in the same directory as the main.py file and where filename is the name of your input database.  
      
python3 main.py filename.db

# Names of anyone you have collaborated with (as much as it is allowed within the course policy) or a line saying that you did not collaborate with anyone else.  
We did not collaborate with anyone else outside this group.    

# More detail of any AI tool used.
Used AI to help test app by populating database.
